🕒 Leveling Up with Python's datetime Module! 💻🐍

I dove deep into Python’s powerful datetime module — starting from the basics and building up to mini-projects that made time handling actually fun.

✅ Learned to work with date, time, and timedelta
✅ Parsed and formatted custom date/time strings
✅ Explored real-world use cases with 2 projects:

1 Age Calculator — find your exact age in years, months, and days

2 Countdown Timer — a live terminal countdown using timedelta

These projects really helped solidify my understanding of date/time logic and opened my eyes to practical automation ideas.

📌 Next up: turning one of these into a simple GUI or web app!

Feel free to check out the code or connect if you’re exploring Python too — always happy to exchange ideas.
